# Dotfiles
Welcome to my personal dotfiles repository.
Feel free to play around, explore, but be careful if you're trying to blindly use them.

The `install.sh` will do the needful for you. In order, it will do the following for you -
* Install brew dependencies mentioned in Brewfile.
* Symlink gitconfig and gitignore_global files.
* Setup zsh for you.
* Setup VSCode extension for you.
* Install cht.sh for you.

After the script installs, do the followin - 
* Open iTerm, and load the configurations from iterm folder. Make sure you install the Mezlo font first.
* Open VSCode and use Settings Sync to perform sanity of settings.
